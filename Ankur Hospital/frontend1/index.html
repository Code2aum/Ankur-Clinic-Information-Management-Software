            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Hospitals interact with a lot of people in a day and there are various
                activities involved in day to day operations of hospitals, for example booking of appointments, managing
                doctor schedules, managing patient diagnoses, managing medical histories of patients, etc. The aim of
                this project is to show how data related to these tasks can be made easier to manage using databases.
